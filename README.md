## 📚 About the Project

Peddy is a pet adoption website developed as part of the Programming Hero Basic Web Development Course, Level 1. This project serves as Assignment 6, focusing on implementing ES6 features and dynamically fetching data from an API. The website displays a variety of pets available for adoption, allowing users to interact with the data in real-time.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Dynamic Data Display:** Fetch and display pet data dynamically from an API.
- **User Interaction:** Implement functional buttons for pet images, adoption processes, and detailed views.
- **Sorting and Filtering:** Enable users to sort pets by categories (like cats and dogs) and filter them by price.

## ✨ Key Features

1. **Like Button:** A functional button that allows users to "like" a pet, pinning its image in a designated box.
2. **Adopt Button:** Initiates the adoption process for selected pets.
3. **Details Button:** Displays pet information fetched from the API in a modal.
4. **Category Sorting:** Users can sort pets by different categories, such as cats and dogs, using category buttons.
5. **Price Sorting:** Pets can be sorted from highest to lowest price with a dedicated sort button.

## ⚙️ ES6 Features Used

- **Arrow Functions:** Simplified function syntax for cleaner code.
- **Template Literals:** Enhanced string interpolation for better readability and formatting.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/): For structuring the web pages.
